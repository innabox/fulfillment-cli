You must specify at least the identifier or name of one object to delete. For example, to delete the
cluster with identifier '123':

{{ binary }} delete cluster 123

Or to delete the cluster with name 'my-cluster':

{{ binary }} delete cluster my-cluster

You can also specify multiple identifiers or names. For example, to delete the clusters with
identifiers '123' and '456':

{{ binary }} delete cluster 123 456

Use the '--help' option to get more details about the command.
