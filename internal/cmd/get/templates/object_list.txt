The following object types are available:

{{ range .Helper.Names -}}
- {{ . }}
{{ end }}

You can use the above fully qualified names, or the short names:

{{ range .Helper.Plurals -}}
- {{ . }}
{{ end }}

For example, to get the list of clusters:

  {{ .Binary }} get fulfillment.v1.Cluster

Or:

  {{ .Binary }} get clusters

Note that the short names may be ambiguous if the same object type exists in different packages. In
that case the one whose fully qualified name appears first in the list will be used.

Use the '--help' option to get more details about the command.
